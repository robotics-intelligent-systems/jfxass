# Hydrogen Truck for Zero-Emission Powertrain

DrivAerNet++ covers all conventional car designs. The dataset encompasses various underbody and wheel designs to represent both internal combustion engine (ICE) and electric vehicles (EV). Free library from the Modelica Association for interface definitions and architectures for vehicle system modeling. Model of a parallel-series hybrid-electric vehicle with system-level and detailed variants of electrical system. The Eclipse SDV Blueprints project is a collaborative initiative led by Eclipse SDV members to bring the software defined vehicle concepts to life. Smart Electric Vehicle Charge Controller. Free library that contains models with different complexity for simulating of electric energy storages like batteries (single cells as well as stacks) interacting with loads, battery management systems, loads and charging devices. Fleet Management Blueprint is a close to real-life showcase for truck fleet management where trucks run an SDV software stack so that logistics fleet operators can manage apps, data and services for a diverse set of vehicles. Eclipse Velocitas provides a development toolchain to create containerized in-vehicle applications (Vehicle Apps) that offers a comfortable, fast and efficient development experience to increase the velocity of a development team. OSCAR IDE is an end-to-end design tool covering both hardware and software modules of an autonomous car. ICEngines repository contains examples, tutorials, and libraries related to internal combustion engine simulations using OpenFOAM. Modelica-MVEMLib is a free Modelica implementation of a Mean Value Engine modeling framework. CARLA-Autoware-Bridge - Enables the use of CARLA for Testing and Development of Autoware Core/Universe. The Rally Fighter was a small-run open-source production vehicle built by Local Motors. System for measuring and displaying various values in caravans and motor homes, including climate values, fill levels and leveling data, energy data, propane/butane sensor.
